This function is an order of magnitude approximation for the Novikov-Thorne
temperature profile for a radiation-pressure dominated accretion disc:

    T ∝ R^(-3/4)

And the ideal gas temperature and sound speed relation

    cₛ^2 ∝ T^4

!!! note

    There will be some dependence on the metric in this function, but to get
    going this is probably good enough.
