## Relevant software
- [Gradus.jl](https://github.com/astro-group-bristol/Gradus.jl) the general relativistic ray tracing software we'll be using.
- This requires [Julia](https://julialang.org/) to be installed.
- You might want to use a development environment like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Julia extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=julialang.language-julia).
